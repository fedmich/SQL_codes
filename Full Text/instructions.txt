We need to do the following for better results on the Searching.

* Edit C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini and add the following on the mysqld section below
# The MySQL server
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len = 2

* Restart MySQL service

* Repair the tables that the full text indexes will be used on.

This is to allow user to search with 3 characters only. example "Zoo" -> doesnt show much records.
the default mysql fulltext minimum length is 4
